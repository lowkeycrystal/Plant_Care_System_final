# Mobile Application Monitoring System for Proper Care of Ornamental Plants with QR Code Integration

## Abstract
  Plant trade became popular in the Philippines after the COVID-19 emerged. Inline with this trend are the challenges that an aspiring plant enthusiast faces in order to properly take care of the plants they have acquired. This study aims to help new plant owners in taking care of their high value ornamental plants with the use of an efficient monitoring system. The researchers developed a monitoring system that can be installed in a mobile phone and connected to the device to gather environmental data. Furthermore, the gathered information will be processed to give users the recommendation for appropriate location, water, and light intensity for each plant with the aid of Fuzzy technique. In addition, a QR code will be generated for each plant and can be scanned to retrieve the plant data. </br></br>
  The system uses Flutter for the application development while C/C++ is utilized for the development of the device which is composed of a resistive soil moisture sensor, BH1750 light sensor, DHT 11 humidity and temperature sensor, and HM10 BLE Bluetooth Module. Moreover, a local board, GizDuino, is used. In terms of the database, a no SQL database, Firebase, is utilized to store all the plant information and plant characteristics.</br></br>
  This study highlights the impact of new technologies and innovation when it comes to growing plants and attempts to underscore the concept of a system that will help the new age gardener embrace the convenience brought by technology.</br>
